        beauiful without you. Good times pass away so fast, no. Abhi thode se
        time phle hi to mile thhe hm, when you asked me if I was Vikash Sir ki
        sis. And see, now my life seems incomplete without you. There was this
        bonding and understanding from the very first day, and it's getting
        better everyday. Okay we do fight sometimes, but I promise, you will
        always find me by your side, in any situation whatsoever.Thoda aap meko
