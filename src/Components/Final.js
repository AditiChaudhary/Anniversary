        Cheers to the one year and many more to come!! I just wanted you to know
        that I admire you right from the day we met. You have always been so
        caring, so understanding, just as crazy as I am. Very soon, you became
        the person with whom I could share anything, whom I could trust blindly.
        You are the best thing that could ever happen to me. I just knew I could
        not afford to lose you. We saw some bad times too, but they just took us
        one step closer to each other. We will make through all the bad times,
        all I need is you.
        <br />
        This was thoda sa effort to thank the person who could make me smile
        through the hardest times, who has always been there with me, who
        tolerates all my stupidity and with whom I can just be myself. I just
        can't put down in words how much this means to me. Okay abhi thoda jyada
        ho rha h, well I hate you anyways‚òπÔ∏è
