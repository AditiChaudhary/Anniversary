              Is photo me aap glti se aa gye☹️ This was the first time we met,
              although text pe kaafi baate kr li thhi. Talking to you has always
              been such a fun. Ese hi random bakchodi krte krte itna close aa
              gye. Or iske bad kabhi parents ki ya dosto ki ya kisi close friend
              ki absence feel nhi hui. You were my all in one package😛 It was
              like I new you for ages. Kabhi feel hi nhi hua ki abhi kuch time
              phle hi to mile thhe hm. Infact meko to abhi bhi lgta h ki thode
              se time phle hi to college aae thhe, itna jldi itna saara time
              kese nikal gya😅

              and talking about things, what can be better than that. There was

              And here comes the time of decision. Remember last year these
              days, kitna awkward sa ho rkha thha sab. I seriously didn't know
              what to do, what to say, what not to say, I was just out of mind,
              and so were you. I only had this thing in my mind that I am not
              going to loose this person at any cost. And then one year back, I
              took the best decision of my life. Ek sal to ho gya ese hi
              bakchodi krte hue, baaki jindagi bhi ese hi nikal jaegi and I am
              damn sure, I am never gonna regret this decision, neither will
              you. And then this place, 9th December, 1-2 hr milna thha and we
              took more than 4 hours. Pta nhi time itna jldi kese nikal jaata h
              when we are together. Or new year eve, beautiful time❤️ Every
              moment with you has been lot more special.
